Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, [install bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) as well\n2. Run `bower install shower-ribbon`\n3. Link theme files from `bower_components/shower-ribbon` to your presentation\n4. There’s `index.html` file inside demonstrating all Ribbon features\n\n### npm\n\n1. Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed\n2. Run `npm install shower-ribbon`\n3. Link theme files from `node_modules/shower-ribbon` to your presentation\n4. There’s `index.html` file inside demonstrating all Ribbon features\n\n## Customizing theme\n\nIf you want to build your own theme based on Ribbon you need to set up development environment based on Node.js and Grunt.\n\n1. [Fork Ribbon repository](https://github.com/shower/ribbon/fork), clone your fork to a local computer\n2. Run `npm install` and `bower install` to get all dependencies\n3. Runt `gulp` to start local server with watcher\n5. Edit theme, mostly SCSS files inside `styles` folder\n\n---\nLicensed under [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), see [license page](https://github.com/shower/shower/wiki/MIT-License) for details.\n",
